# Overview

In this homework, you will work with [the Abalone
dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone) from the UCI
Machine Learning Repository.

To get started, download and import the `abalone.data` dataset from this
URL:

-   <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/abalone/abalone.data>

You can pass the URL directly to `read.csv()` and that there is no
header row.

Note: The instruction to print in the questions below can be
accomplished either through the `print()` function or by displaying a
value directly.

**TOTAL POINTS: 7**

# Tasks

## Task 0

(0 points)

Get the dataset.

```{r}
data_abalone <-read.csv('https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/abalone/abalone.data')
head(data_abalone,3)
```
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
## Task 1

(1 point)

Print the number of rows in the dataset.

```{r}
data_abalone%>%count()
```

## Task 2

(1 point)

The rightmost column is the number of rings. Print the maximum number of
rings

```{r}
data_abalone%>%summarise(max_rings = max(X15))

```

## Task 3

(1 point)

The leftmost column is the gender with these values: `M`: male, `F`:
female, `I`: infant.

Apply the `filter()` function from tidyverse to select only rows where
gender is infant, and print the number of records.

```{r}
data_abalone%>%filter(M == 'I')%>%count()
```

## Task 4

(1 point)

Apply the `filter()` function from `tidyverse` to select only rows where
gender is infant or male, and print the number of records.

```{r}
data_abalone%>%filter(M == 'I'|M == 'M')%>%count()
```

## Task 5

(1 point)

Call the `table()` function on the abalone genders to find out how many
of each gender are present.

Print the result.

```{r}
table(data_abalone$M)
```

## Task 6

(1 point)

Compute the mean value of column 2 (V2) grouped by gender.

V2 is the longest shell measurement.

Requirements: use the `%>%` operator to chain commands, and the
`group_by()` and `summarize()` functions.

```{r}
data_abalone%>%group_by(M)%>%
  summarize(mean_V2 = mean(X0.455))
```

# Task 7

(1 point)

Compute the MEDIAN value of longest shell measurement for only the
males.

Requirements: use the `%>%` operator to chain commands.

```{r}
data_abalone%>%
  filter(M == 'M')%>%
  summarize(median_V2 = median(X0.455))
```
